# **AI-Based Deception Detection in Video Footage**

## **Overview**
The AI-Based Deception Detection project aims to identify deception by analyzing micro-expressions, voice tone, and body language from video data. This project utilizes facial emotion detection and basic audio tone analysis to determine potential signs of deceit, providing insights into human behavior that can be used in applications such as security, interviews, and investigations.

### **Features**
- **Micro-Expression Analysis**: Detects facial emotions using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- **Audio Tone Analysis**: Analyzes audio pitch to detect stress-related indicators.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Analyzes video footage frame-by-frame and synchronizes it with audio input.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, Dlib, Imutils, TensorFlow/Keras, Librosa, Numpy, PyAudio
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Facial Emotion Detection (Keras/TensorFlow-based)

## **Prerequisites**
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to a computer with a camera (for real-time testing) or video files.
- Basic understanding of Python, machine learning models, and audio/video processing.
